## 💡 Future Enhancements

### 1. Real-Time API Deployment
- Integrate model with **UPI gateways** or banking systems through REST APIs.  
- Enable **live fraud scoring** for every incoming transaction.  
- Send alerts or block suspicious transactions instantly.

### 2. Cost-Sensitive and Risk-Aware Learning
- Incorporate **monetary cost functions** to minimize financial losses.  
- Assign higher penalties for missed frauds (False Negatives) compared to false alerts.  
- Dynamically adjust thresholds based on real-time business impact.

### 3. Model Explainability
- Implement SHAP or LIME for explaining individual predictions.  
- Help analysts understand why a transaction was classified as fraudulent.

### 4. Continuous Learning
- Monitor data drift using statistical metrics.  
- Automate retraining and model updates with new fraud patterns.
